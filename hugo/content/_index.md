# DSA Spark
#### _It's Lit._

We are DSA Spark, members of the Democratic Socialists of America dedicated to radical democracy, Marxist analysis, and a communist future. We aim to transform the Democratic socialists of America into a working class political party capable of fighting for socialism at home and abroad. Our goals include: ensuring DSAâ€™s elected officials and organizers remain accountable to the rank-and-file, the adoption of a program detailing the minimum requirements of working class political rule, a definitive break with the Democratic party, and a merger of socialism with the workers movement.
