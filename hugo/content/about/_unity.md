Points of Unity outline for the DSA Spark

1. Internal to DSA
  - Commitment to democratic and pluralist principles
     - Open and public criticism / debate
     - Branches / caucuses / working groups can have their own newspapers, newsletters, pamphlets, etc
     - Transparency of decision making
  - Commitment to republican principles
     - “Control the bureaucrats”
     - Subordination of leadership and bureaucrats / staff to rank and file
     - Right of recall
     - Plebiscites / referenda
     - Term limits for leadership positions at all levels where possible
     - Rotation of duties / development of all members as much as possible in administrative capabilities
  - Min / max program
     - Programmatic and action based unity over theoretical unity
       - Stress communism as end goal
       - Immediate demands?
         - So like, a three tier program
           - What we want right now
           - What we need to establish Working Class political rule
           - What happens after the working class rule, ie communism
2. Domestic
  - Rejection of bourgeois parties
    - No using Democratic ballot lines
    - Commitment to forming an independent, socialist, working class political party
  - Merger of socialism and the worker movement
    - Which also means reinvigorating the worker movement
    - Working within existing unions
      - Existing unions are not enough - need to go beyond mere trade- (or industrial-) unionism
  - Reforms not reformism
    - Expansion of economic and political rights for the working class
    - “Peacefully if we can, forcefully if we must”
      - Probably gonna be forceful though, let’s be real
    - Police and prison abolition
    - Rejection of “market socialism” or a “mixed economy”
    - Refusal to manage the capitalist state
    - Refusal to approve budgets
      - Basically the SPD model
      - Denying bourgeois parties the ability to attack workers
      - Combat racism, sexism, homophobia, etc where it exists currently - not waiting for communism to solve the problems
        - Opposition to the carceral state (no support for candidates or organizations that call for increasing the power or manpower of the police or military)
3. Internationalism
  - Rejection of “Actually Existing Socialism” models
     - Use CLT’s language on Workers’ Republics here? (point 5 in their PoU)
     - This should also include bonapartist / populist regimes like Venezuela
  - Anti-imperialism
     - Not like, “anti-imp at all costs, defend the Iranian regime!” type stuff though but more opposition to wars, unequal treaties, “humanitarian interventions,” etc. We can oppose American imperialism and local rulers (Assad, Iranian clerics, etc)
  - Revolutionary defeatism
