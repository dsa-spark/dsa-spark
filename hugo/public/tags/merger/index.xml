      <description>Two communist DSA caucuses, Refoundation and Spark, are happy to announce we are unifying into a single caucus under the Refoundation banner.
Refoundation will benefit from the sharp insight and strategic seriousness that our Spark comrades will bring, and we could not be more proud to have them join and improve our already significant and expanding project.
Spark in its turn hopes to add a commitment to internal reform to an already robust Refoundation platform, with emphasis on a term-limited and recallable DSA leadership.</description>
